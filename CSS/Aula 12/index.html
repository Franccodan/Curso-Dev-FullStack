        <p>Hello, my name is Daniel Franco, I am 22 years old and I currently work with a help desk in a technology company here in Brazil, more specifically in Capivari in the interior of SÃ£o Paulo, I really like working in this area that I work today, but my desire for the future is to be a software and websites developer, having this desire with me I decided to start with this curriculum developed by me 100% in HTML and CSS.</p>

                    <h4>Agitech Tecnologia e Internet</h4>
                    <h5>Help Desk - 2021 to currently</h5>
                    <p>My work routine is directly linked to the user, every day I answer calls from different companies and people remotely or in person.
                        One thing that I found very interesting about working with a help desk and that made me learn, grow and develop was the routine, every day a different problem that takes me out of my comfort zone and shows me that in the IT world we will never know all the answers.</p>
